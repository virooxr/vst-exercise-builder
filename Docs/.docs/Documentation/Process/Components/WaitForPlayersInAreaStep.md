# Wait For Player Detection Step

This step will wait for all connected users to move to a determined area.
This can be useful to define "safe areas" before teleporting users to another area.

## Create a Player Detection Area

To add a player detection area to the scene you can do it by adding the `PlayerDetectionArea` prefab.

This prefab will show a footprints icon on the floor to indicate users where they must move to.
